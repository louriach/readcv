A living, breathable list of what I believe makes great products.

 1. Trust your gut

 2. Test with the real product

 3. Craft over consistency

 4. Experience matters

 5. Focus on problems that matter

 6. No one owns ideas

 7. Technical debt is a good thing

 8. Donâ€™t reinvent the wheel

 9. Be in the right place at the right time

10. Keep the team as lean as possible

11. Avoid over-optimisations, focus on business value

12. MVPs should not be abandoned

13. Would we be satisfied if we could never update this again?
