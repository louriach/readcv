title: Portfolios: Prioritise pixels over presentations

The more I talk to hiring managers and senior designers about what they are looking for in designers, the more I back up the theory that portfolios shouldn't be X, Y, Z case studies, but explorations of your obsession with details.

Showing deep, deep examinations of your solutions AND what you didn't deliver is a really great way to show how you approach solving a problem. A slideshow of solutions doesn't show anything below the surface, just a public-facing polished mockup.

But! Jumping incredibly deep into your rough work can show that you really do take the end to end product process into consideration when solving a problem.

"This didn't work, because..." is a fascinating discussion that I know would be way more interesting than "here's a flow" during a conversation with a hiring manager.

The question is therefore: How can you prove that you are "obsessed" with the details? Craft is becoming a key differentiator in software products, and design (AKA you) has the power to drive this forward, how will you enable this company to push the boundaries of quality?

The good news is that I'm confident this works in designer's favour! So many designers explain that they can't build a portfolio because "they don't have much to show", but what if you flipped it?

Take a single element on a single screen from a single feature. How much detail went into this? How granular can you get with the pixel-level detail of your every move?
