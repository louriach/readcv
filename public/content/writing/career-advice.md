title: Career advice
description: By Luis

* Bias for action

* Talk to the room you're in: kick acronyms and buzzwords to the kerb

* Over-communicate project status

* Bullets, not paragraphs

* Talk slower

* Share everything you know

* Build a consistency muscle

* Ask for help

* Less "I", more "we"
