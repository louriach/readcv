title: ðŸ’¡Loose thoughts: Variants, nesting, and component performance in Figma

When it comes to components, performance is incredibly important and there's a very common question when planning systems.

What's more performant?

1. A single (mega) variant

2. Nested and bubbled instances

### Let's analyse!

Here's what we're trying to achieve â€“ an avatar component with:

1. 30 different avatar options

2. 3 shapes â€“ circle, square, rectangle

3. 5 sizes â€“ x small, small, medium, large, x large

In the single variant option, this ends up with **319 components**. In the bubbled instance we have **41 components** (30 options plus the variant options).

Immediately, we can see a maintenance win, but is it more performant? Let's take a look at the layers.

![A comparison of the numbers of layers between each approach.](/content/writing/component-performance-2.jpg)

For the Single variant â€“ **5,120 layers**.\
For the nested instance approach â€“ **4,482 layers**.

This is a nearly **15% increase** in size! It's worth thinking about this at scale within a file. With tonnes of instances in a file, you can imagine how this would bubble out into your file's performance at scale.

So that settles it! The nested instance approach is way more performant ðŸŽ‰

### Wait there's more

I might have tricked you on this one. For the avatar component example, this is probably not the best way to build that specific component. Given it's a large list of images, it can be made way more performant with...styles!

Reducing the variant set down to the compositional changes â€“ size and radius â€“ allows you to offload the stylistic variations within the avatars to your styles. Each avatar can be created as a style, and your designers can swap them out!

### And there's even more

Variables! If your avatar is consolidated into a single shape with incremental radii as it gets larger/small â€“ then you can use variable modes to reduce the component set even more.

Of course, this is stylistically very different to the first options, but worth considering is consistency and performance are your ultimate goals!
